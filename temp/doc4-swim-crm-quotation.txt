Cancellation/change email + SMS templates              Templates
Basic reporting (enrollment/revenue by session)        Dashboard

5. What GoHighLevel Handles Well

The following functionality is native to GHL and will be implemented without custom development:

- Pipeline + opportunity custom fields for swimmer/session data
- Group calendars with capacity limits per time slot
- Form builder with field mapping to contacts/opportunities
- Native Stripe integration for payment processing
- Workflow automations (triggers, actions, tagging, email/SMS)
- Smart Lists for filtering contacts by session/level/day
- Email and SMS templates for bulk communications
- Review generation campaigns
- Private lesson workflows and calendars
- Automated progress/performance emails via instructor input forms
- Basic dashboard widgets for enrollment counts

6. Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly excluded from this engagement:

- Instructor/staff tools (on-deck skill tracking, instructor dashboards)
- Swim team platform integrations
- Makeup class tracking and automated rescheduling logic
- Deep historical data migration and deduplication
- Custom-coded portals or web applications

7. GHL Platform Limitations

Be aware of this platform constraint:

- No native child records: Swimmers are tracked via Opportunity fields, not as separate child contacts. Multi-child families require multiple opportunities.

8. Assumptions

This estimate assumes:

- Client provides all required assets before work begins (see below)
- The client will complete Stripe integration, or will provide us with the Stripe account access, or we can guide them on this integration.
- GHL account is active with the required subscription level
- Single round of revisions included per phase
- Existing website remains the marketing front-end (links to GHL for registration)

9. Client Prerequisites

To meet the estimated timeline, the following must be provided before kickoff:

- Finalized 6-week session pricing
- Approved liability waiver text (from legal/insurance)
- Photo/media consent text
- Class capacity limits by level and time slot
- Weekend schedule (days, times, duration per class)
- GHL account admin access
- Session start/end dates for initial setup

10. Deliverables Summary

1. Configured Swim Lessons pipeline with custom fields and tags
2. 5 group lesson calendars (Levels 1-5) with correct availability/capacity
3. Registration form with waiver/consent integration
4. Payment flow configured (client completes Stripe connection)
5. Core booking workflow (contact/opportunity creation, tagging, confirmation email/SMS)
6. Roster Smart Lists for each session/time slot

- Phase 2: Session Management & Communications will take 10 hours and will include repeatable session setup, reminders, bulk messaging, and basic reporting.
- The client must provide all required assets before work begins, including finalized 6-week session pricing, approved liability waiver text, photo/media consent text, class capacity limits, and weekend schedule details.
- The project assumes a single round of revisions per phase and that the existing website will remain the marketing front-end.
