  },
  "task_description": "I have met with the client and the following is what they need help with:\n\nURGENT: New Order email is being sent to buyer instead of the seller. The setting in Woocommerce 'Emails' looks correct but client says they are not receiving the New Order email but the customer is - perhaps there is a configuration issue with one of the plugins they added?\n\nRemove the 'Enter you height for each pair in cm or feet' field from the checkout page https://phystep.com/checkout/\n\n'State / County' field change so it works as optional - currently the client says if this is field is not completed then the purchase fails so they need it to be optional.\n\nChange placeholder text 'House number and street name' to 'Address Line 1'\n\nCheck Stripe payments plugin - the client wants to include Google and Apple pay. The options for these are checked in the settings but do not display as payment methods when the user goes to the Payment page\n\nOn payment window there is a agree to terms and conditions checkbox that is mandatory but there is no message to alert the user they must check that box. If the user doesn't check the box then proceeds, the checkbox does not display an error message requiring them to agree so we need to fix that.\n\nChange Woo settings so they are only selling/shipping to Baltic region countries: Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania\n\nNOTE: the client is going to be working on the site making changes to some of their pages and I have told them we are not touching any pages of the site as we'll just need to work on the Woo settings etc. They need to have the items above completed before Monday as they are doing some promotion and need to be sure everything is working with the shopping cart so please proceed with the work above ASAP.",
  "task_comments": [
    "Comment 1: We have completed the following changes - Remove the 'Enter you height for each pair in cm or feet' field, 'State / County' field changed to optional, placeholder text changed to 'Address Line 1'. We need FTP access for remaining issues: New Order email issue, Stripe payments with Google/Apple pay, and terms checkbox error message.",
    "Comment 2: The client has added the CheckoutWC plugin. Points 2 and 3 are CheckoutWC overrides - please review them. Need to check URGENT email issue, Stripe payments plugin for Google/Apple pay, and terms checkbox error message.",
    "Comment 3: Please check this.",
    "Comment 4: We replaced the seller's email with our test email and placed a test order - successfully received New Order email. For Stripe/Google/Apple pay - the issue is with CheckoutWC plugin version 7.8.4, documentation shows Express Checkout option in version 10.1.16. Plugin needs manual update. Terms checkbox error message has been fixed.",
    "Comment 5: Completed changes summary - Email issue tested and working, Terms checkbox error fixed, Baltic countries added (Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania). For Google/Apple pay - CheckoutWC plugin needs update from 7.8.4 to 10.1.16 for Express Checkout functionality.",
