task 2


task description:- 
I have met with the client and the following is what they need help with:

    URGENT: New Order email is being sent to buyer instead of the seller. The setting in Woocommerce 'Emails' looks correct but client says they are not receiving the New Order email but the customer is - perhaps there is a configuration issue with one of the plugins they added?
    Remove the 'Enter you height for each pair in cm or feet' field from the checkout page https://phystep.com/checkout/Zoom image.pngimage (20).png 23.6 KB View full-size Download
    'State / County' field change so it works as optional - currently the client says if this is field is not completed then the purchase fails so they need it to be optional.
    Change placeholder text 'House number and street name' to 'Address Line 1'
    Check Stripe payments plugin - the client wants to include Google and Apple pay. The options for these are checked in the settings but do not display as payment methods when the user goes to the Payment page
    On payment window there is a agree to terms and conditions checkbox that is mandatory but there is no message to alert the user they must check that box. If the user doesn't check the box then proceeds, the checkbox does not display an error message requiring them to agree so we need to fix that.
    Change Woo settings so they are only selling/shipping to Baltic region countries: Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania

NOTE: the client is going to be working on the site making changes to some of their pages and I have told them we are not touching any pages of the site as we'll just need to work on the Woo settings etc. They need to have the items above completed before Monday as they are doing some promotion and need to be sure everything is working with the shopping cart so please proceed with the work above ASAP.

We have completed the following changes. You can review them here: https://phystep.com/checkout/

Remove the 'Enter you height for each pair in cm or feet' field from the checkout page https://phystep.com/checkout/

'State / County' field change so it works as optional - currently the client says if this is field is not completed then the purchase fails so they need it to be optional.

Change placeholder text 'House number and street name' to 'Address Line 1'

We have reviewed the following items but need more time to investigate further. However, we require FTP access details to proceed. Could you please provide them?

URGENT: New Order email is being sent to buyer instead of the seller. The setting in Woocommerce 'Emails' looks correct but client says they are not receiving the New Order email but the customer is - perhaps there is a configuration issue with one of the plugins they added?

Check Stripe payments plugin - the client wants to include Google and Apple pay. The options for these are checked in the settings but do not display as payment methods when the user goes to the Payment page

On payment window there is a agree to terms and conditions checkbox that is mandatory but there is no message to alert the user they must check that box. If the user doesn't check the box then proceeds, the checkbox does not display an error message requiring them to agree so we need to fix that.

We need to remove all the countries shown here. You can review screenshot here: https://prnt.sc/qp3ztz4dKKAk and add only the below three: 

1. Change Woo settings so they are only selling/shipping to Baltic region countries: Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania

Please check and let us know if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Ca you please check below points on this website: https://phystep.com/

The client has added the CheckoutWC plugin. Points 2 and 3 are CheckoutWC overrides i think — please review them.

Hello @Jayesh Patoliya﻿ 

We have investigated the issues you reported and taken the necessary steps to test, validate, and resolve each one. Below is a detailed breakdown of our findings, actions taken, and next steps (where applicable) for your review.

Site: https://phystep.com/

1) We replaced the seller’s email address with our test email and placed a test order. We successfully received the New Order email as the seller. After the test, we reverted the email address back to your original address.
Please review the reference email we received as a seller: https://tinyurl.com/yoaz6s2g
We also sent a test email to info@phystep.com. Kindly confirm if you received it.
If possible, please place a test order and confirm whether the seller's email has been received at info@phystep.com. If not, let us know, and we will place another test order for verification.

2) We investigated the issue and found that the issue is with the CheckoutWC plugin, so we referred to the plugin documentation, where the Express Checkout section shows a configuration option that enables Apple and Google Pay: https://prnt.sc/GnKFdSIBBQcj
However, this option is not visible in the version currently installed on the site.
We initially assumed the plugin was up to date, but on further inspection, we found that the current version is 7.8.4: https://prnt.sc/AXUoS4bUi61H, whereas the documentation shows the latest version as 10.1.16: https://prnt.sc/OZMJXOBWJ2EX
Since no update option is available within the WordPress dashboard, we believe the plugin must be manually updated using the latest version from your purchase account.
Kindly share the latest version of the plugin with us so we can update it and test the Express Checkout functionality with Apple and Google Pay.

3) We have addressed this issue. The required checkbox now correctly displays an error message when the user attempts to proceed without checking it. For your reference, please see the updated behaviour: https://prnt.sc/5avCrBAEXPBz

Thanks!
