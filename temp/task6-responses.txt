==========================================
Task: WooCommerce checkout and email configuration for phystep.com

==========================================
GPT-4o Response
==========================================
Overview:
The task involves addressing several urgent issues on a client's WooCommerce site, primarily focusing on email notifications, checkout page modifications, payment options, and regional shipping settings. The client requires these changes to be completed promptly for an upcoming promotion.

Key Points:
1. **Email Notification Issue**: The New Order email is incorrectly sent to the buyer instead of the seller. Initial tests with a test email indicate the issue may be resolved, but further verification is needed.

2. **Checkout Page Modifications**:
   - Removed the 'Enter your height for each pair' field.
   - Changed 'State / County' field to optional to prevent purchase failures.
   - Updated placeholder text to 'Address Line 1'.

3. **Payment Options**: 
   - The client wants to enable Google and Apple Pay via the Stripe plugin. The current CheckoutWC plugin version (7.8.4) does not support this; an update to version 10.1.16 is required for Express Checkout functionality.

4. **Terms and Conditions Checkbox**: 
   - Fixed the issue where no error message was displayed if the mandatory checkbox was not checked.

5. **Regional Shipping Settings**: 
   - Configured WooCommerce settings to restrict sales and shipping to the Baltic region (Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania).

6. **Client Coordination**: 
   - The client is making changes to site pages independently. The team is focusing solely on WooCommerce settings and related issues.

7. **Completion and Review**: 
   - All changes have been implemented and can be reviewed on the client's website. Further action is required for the Stripe plugin update to enable Google/Apple Pay.
