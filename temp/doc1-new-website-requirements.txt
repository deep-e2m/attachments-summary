Google analytics and data tracking embedded for marketing purposes - we will provide codes etc

An area for latest news/blog content for SEO reasons

In the back end a space where registers and sign ups can be easily viewed and extracted for compliance and company organisation reasons

Any extras/you may also be interested in option when the basket is open. (these would mostly be upcoming one off events) - see ticketmaster example above

During selection of pathway sessions a customer will have to select sport/arts or tutoring and then the selected discipline – lists will be provided - this is just a dropdown list

An opportunity to select available recurring session time such as attached link also needed for pathways – week availability should be shown for selection -

More detailed notes for consideration

For the membership style sign out options something similar to the attached would be initial preference - https://ecom.docusign.com/en-GB/plans-and-pricing/esignature?_gl=1*5yr3qq*_gcl_au*MTYzMzcyMjYxNy4xNzMxMDY4MTgx

For Holiday club/sports club bookings requirement is Mutiple calendar selection and quantity option for e.g. if I want to book 2 children into the whole week, I should be able to select this in the calendar view for automatic feedthrough to my basket. - WP Booking Calendar – WordPress plugin | WordPress.org - multiple dates selectable

In some circumstances such as when a customer selects a platinum pathway subscription they also recieve the unlimited group sessions, how is best for this to work on the site (is it to be auto added to their basket) they would also receive automatic savings on sports camps could this trigger when they are locked in or would it have to be a code?

Can the invoice option only appear when the school/orgnisation option is in the basket?
